When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

    I would use remote repositories when collaborating with others or
    when I want to share the my source code to the public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There could be possible conflicts and pull does not seem to care
    about that.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When
would you use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones on github linking back to its original repositories.
    Clones are copies of the repositories downloaded from github. Whereas,
    branches are copies you make within your repository to test an experi-
    mental feature or another change which is not production ready.
    Branches are created with the intention to diverge from the master
    and test something experimental. Once, it is working fine, you can merge
    it back to master. When collaborating, cloning is the simplest way to give
    someone the code. Whereas, if you are collaborating via github, you can fork
    instead of clone for easy merging and pulling of latest versions from such
    user.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
remote stored locally?
